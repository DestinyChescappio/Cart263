      <h2>**TOP SECRET!! DO NOT DISTRIBUTE!**</h2>

      <p>
        An Oregon man intent on proving the existence of the mythical creatures
        known as Bigfoot, Sasquatch, the Abominable Snowman and Yeti in 1976
        managed to get the FBI
        <span class="top-secret redacted">
          to test hair and tissue samples that he believed might help his case,
          according to newly released records. The FBI has analyzed hair in
          connection with the search for Sasquatch, aka ‘Bigfoot,’” an internal
          FBI memo noted in February 1977</span
        >.
      </p>

      <p>
        On Wednesday, the same man who spurred that analysis, 93-year-old Peter
        Byrne, told CNBC that he still hasn’t given up hope of proving that
        Bigfoot is a
        <span class="top-secret redacted"
          >real — if exceedingly rare — creature.</span
        >
        “It’s a great challenge,” Byrne said, when asked to explain his interest
        over nine decades in finding creatures widely believed to be figments of
        imagination, or the inventions of con men. Byrne’s web page says that he
        “has always had an interest in the unknown and the mysterious” since his
        father used to tell him bedtime stories about the Yeti of the Himalayas.
        The page says his “first opportunity to go looking for the Yeti occurred
        in 1946, when he was still in the British Royal Air Force in Bombay,
        India.”
      </p>

      <p>
        A photo on that page shows him “with
        <span class="top-secret redacted"
          >the famous Yeti scalp” at a temple in the Himalayas in Nepal in 1958.
          Another photo shows a very big footprint of a possible Bigfoot </span
        >. His desire to see a Yeti for himself led him to launch three
        extensive expeditions searching for the Yeti in Nepal in the late 1950s.
        Byrne said that in the past 50 years he had found two or three sets
        <span class="top-secret redacted"
          >of possible Yeti footprints, with five toes on each foot, left in
          tracks in the Himalayas, at altitudes of 15,000 feet.</span
        >
        But he conceded Wednesday that those prints could have been left by
        Hindu holy men, or sadhus, whom he has seen walking barefoot in the
        snows at such heights.
      </p>

        After moving to the U.S. the 1960s, Byrne went on to direct “The Bigfoot
        Information Center and Exhibition” in Oregon. With the backing of what
        he said were wealthy men, he tried to find conclusive evidence of
        Bigfoot, also known as Sasquatch in America’s Pacific Northwest. “I was
        in it full time, seven days a week,” Byrne said of his earlier Bigfoot
        hunts, which last were funded in the 1990s. “Right now, I’m still
        active,” Byrne said. “We have motion-sensitive cameras out in the
        mountains” of Oregon, he said. But, he added, “it’s a hobby for me now.”
        When told about the FBI documents
        <span class="top-secret redacted">
          showing his correspondence with the agency in the 1970s asking it to
          test hair samples, Byrne chuckled. But he also said, “I don’t remember
          this.”</span
