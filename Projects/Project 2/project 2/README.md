# Artist Statement

Introduction:
Project 2 is titled, "Anujeeemeechanuuch", which means beadwork or the act of beading in my Indigenous Naskapi Cree language. The simulation consists two parts which is the Introductory and the Interactive page.

Game Concept:
The Introductory page is similar to a start screen/title page but in a sense it is interactive and contains an informative concept of what beadwork is in a contemporary artistic notion. The Interactive page is where the user does the most activity. The user is encouraged to finish a design and take their part of practicing the basics of beadwork design. This page also has clickable objects that link to Indigenous artists that practice beadwork. These links are particularly present to inform and educate the users who wish to further their practice.

Inspiration:
My inspiration for this project is from my traditional practices of Indigenous beadwork. As an Indigenous artist, I feel it is important to be consistent with these cultural practices especially in world of digitization. I also aim to incorporate a virtual experience of beading practices for Indigenous persons who may not have the advantage to learn the basics of beadwork design, and to learn about well-known artists that may influence them to move forward into the practice. In most cases, due to a westernized colonial society, some Indigenous persons are not exposed to these cultural practices or given resources to learn more about Indigenous artists to be inspired from. Essentially, I believe more Indigenous based simulations and games should be more present to hopefully act as a guide for a better future.

Artistic Vision:
In the creative process, I believe I met the project's expectations and successfully demonstrated my ability to creating simulations that consist more content working with more libraries such as p5.play, and demonstrating my knowledge with responsive voice. Although I am known for the classical arcade games that consist dodging, jumping, flying, etc., I initially aimed to demonstrate various styles of simulations; especially working with two separate pages. I challenged myself to further into programming through html, css, and javascript. In the process of creating these beads, it came to my realizations that it was time consuming and required a lot of patience; which I like to compare to the act of traditional beadwork.

Technical:
With technical experience, the process of this particular project have brought me out of my comfort zone into trying new ways of creating a simulation through utilizing p5.play with responsive voice, incorporating CSS and HTML into my usual practice of JavaScript. Although my experience with creating each individual bead is compared to the importance of traditional beadwork with vigorous work and patience, it set back a lot of my time because the beads could not be stored as an array. I hope to find a new method of creating these individual objects (other than arrays that require the same properties; size, positions, behaviour, etc). Generally, this project has brought me to a new vision of creating simulations and games with the help of using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

A Special Thanks to-
The Instructor, T.A's, and CLAB.

I am honoured to be a part of Cart 253/263 throughout my first year at University. This class was the best part of my experience at Concordia <3 I will cherish onto the many amazing techniques and skill I picked up from this class!
