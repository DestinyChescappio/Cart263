# Artist's Statement

Introduction:
Project 1 is titled "Harry Potter's Quidditch Adventures". The game consists the user's character (Harry Potter), the objectives (Snitches), and the enemies (Bludgers). Essentially, I have used p5.play library because the switch between animations while doing an action caught my interest further into game design. I am mostly happy with the outcome.

Game Concept:
The game is set up with three objects; the user's character, the objectives, and the enemies. The bludgers play the enemies trying to sabbotage Harry's attempt to success. Their behaviours is moving across the canvas against harry whilst initializing increased speed when the user passes a level (there are 3 levels total). The bludgers are the main leading cause to Harry losing. The snitches play harry's objective. However the user is challenged to catch all snitches as their behavior of movement changes and moves away from harry when approached. They are harry's ticket to winning quidditch. Harry plays the user's character who is limited to moving past the y axis of the canvas. If he gets hit by bludgers too many times, he loses, if he collects the required snitches, he wins.

Inspiration:
My inspiration came from the movie, "Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone" and "Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets". More specifically, the game is inspired from the scene in the first movie where Harry caught his first snitch. The bludger concept is inspired from the second movie scene where Harry was chased by a bludger. I thought taking inspirations of an old childhood movie of mine and bringing it to life would be reminiscent. Especially since it's been over 20 years since Harry Potter movies began.

Artistic Vision:
In my creative process, I believe I met the project's objectives and successfully demonstrated my ability to advance into creating projects with a different library (p5.play). I envisioned a pixel/vintage game that users who grew up with Harry Potter movies can have a moment to revisit the magic they once grew up with. I included interactivity to have the user play harry potter because who doesn't want to be the main character? I had a good learning experience with incorporating my painting skills with pixel art (shade and highlight is important).

Technical:
With technical exploration, it was a good learning experience working with the new concepts of programming with p5.play, creating a parallax effect, and using levels for the first time. Although I met most of my technical expectations, I felt limited to the potential of the game because some actions I initially planned on could not be executed due to Javascript and p5.play library capabilities. For example, since the GIF snitches did not work due its multiple overlapping when keeping track how many were caught, it was not possible to have GIF play as an object being tracked individually. Another example I was limited to what I wanted to do as well is when I planned the snitch sprites to randomly move, I was told it is impossible because they are sprite arrays and don't have their separate behaviour to move randomly on the canvas. However realizing these things of limitations are not necessarily a bad thing, I may be wrong, but it can be good in a way that it demonstrates my ambition and recognition of programming. I am curious what solutions come next when dealing with these limits and upcoming ones.

A special thank to-

The Instructor, T.A, CLAB, and especially to my fellow class mates pushing me to work with p5.play :)
